# Production Build Configuration for helixgeneralhardware.com
#
# IMPORTANT: Leave VITE_EXTERNAL_API_URL empty for production builds
# The app will automatically use relative /api.php URLs which work on the same domain
# This makes the build portable - it can be deployed to any domain without reconfiguration

# Supabase is NOT used - the app uses the external PHP API (public/api.php)
# Do NOT add Supabase URLs here
